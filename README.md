## About

Traffic Men is an innovative solution designed to monitor and manage traffic patterns. By delivering both real-time and historical traffic data, this project aims to support urban planning, enhance traffic safety, and manage congestion. Its objective is to provide a responsive and user-friendly platform to help cities and communities improve traffic flow and safety.


## Key Features

- **Real-Time Data Integration:** Incorporates traffic data, commuter density, and event information to make data-driven decisions.
- **Predictive Analytics for Demand Forecasting:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms for accurate demand predictions.
- **Adaptive Scheduling & Routing:** Uses AI algorithms to adjust vehicle deployment and routes dynamically.
- **Optimization Engine:** Ensures optimal vehicle dispatching to balance demand and minimize commuter wait times.
  
## Dataset sources:
- **MTC govt websites :** https://mtcbus.tn.gov.in/
- **Opencity :** https://opencity.in/
- **Traffic index :** https://trafficindex.org/

## ML models used :
 - **ARIMA :**  Traffic Forecast
 - **Lasso regression , Ridge regression, Random Forest, Gradient Booster, Support Vector Regressor , Decision Tree, Extra Trees, AdaBoost, XGBoost :** For predicting the commuter demand of mtc.

## Graphical Simulations :
- **Networkx :** Shell_layout, Kamada_Kawai_layout, Spring_layout, Fruchterman_Reingold_layout
